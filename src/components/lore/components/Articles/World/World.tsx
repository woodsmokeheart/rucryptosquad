      <h2>The history of the RCS world</h2>
      <p>
        After a global catastrophe, people were brought to the brink of
        extinction, their numbers dwindled, and each new day represented a
        tragic confrontation between life and death. But fate made its own
        changes, and in sad times, nanite technology, merged with artificial
        intelligence and blockchain, became the last support for the
        survivors...
      </p>
      <div className={styles.image}>

      </div>
      <p>
        Back in time immemorial, before the war of the ancients, talented
        engineering geniuses with a shining desire to cure humanity of many
        diseases began to create nanites. However, no one could have predicted
        that it was these microscopic creations that would become the true light
        of hope for the salvation of the entire human race after a catastrophe
        on a planetary scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mysterious "First Carrier" awakened the mysterious process of
        self-replication of nanites, putting into them the secret grain of
        survival. Gradually and imperceptibly, nanites became firmly intertwined
        with the fabric of human bodies, imposing unshakable resistance to the
        hostility of the environment, accelerating wound healing and granting
        incredible opportunities.
      </p>
      <div className={styles.image}>
        <Image src={img3} alt="hero" sizes="100%" priority />
      </div>
      <p>
        As time passed, people plunged into the sparkling streams of their
        consciousness, becoming one inseparable entity with these invisible
        guardians. The exchange of information proceeded silently, like the
        melody of the wind, weaving their actions into an indestructible
        harmony. Such an association opened the gates to people in an era of
        incredible efficiency in the struggle for survival and became the
        foundation for the birth of communities recreated in the grace of this
        amazing technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the blessed embrace of nanites, nature and people have become one,
        reviving sustainable ecosystems and providing themselves with the
        necessary resources to overcome obstacles. They penetrated into the most
        unthinkable laws of the universe, opening unprecedented technologies,
        opening doors to unexplored possibilities that were previously available
        only in fantasies.
      </p>

      <p>
        But none of these emerging communities possessed such grandeur as the
        Hive City of Etherion. It was created by nanites released by the
        "First", they formed an artificial cavity in the earth of incredible
        size, collecting minerals for their self-replication. Now this creation
        of humans and nanites has an artificial sky of extraordinary beauty with
        projections of planets shining with incredible shades of neon and
        reminding the inhabitants of the Hive of life on the surface. There are
        both industrial and residential areas, nature intersects with
        technology, and the RCS residence tower rises above the underground city
        and is visible from almost every corner of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The population of Ethereon is based on ordinary people, whom the nanites
        endowed with the ability to survive and be resistant to the environment,
        but no more, their minds and skills remained at the level of their
        ancestors – they were not ready to accept the gift of merging with AI.
        The city is run by a powerful organization of the most outstanding
        people with superpowers, who are called RCS. Like the medieval order,
        there is a strict hierarchy, but all decisions are made by the
        collective mind of the DAO structure
      </p>
      <div className={styles.image}>
        <Image src={img8} alt="hero" sizes="100%" priority />
      </div>
      <p>
        Residents are members of the RCS Order, they form its foundation. They
        received from the Nanites the gift of merging with AI and superpowers
        that make them hundreds of times smarter, faster and more resilient than
        ordinary Hive inhabitants. Residents work for the benefit of society,
        their tasks vary, from taking care of resources and ensuring safety to
        supporting the basic functions of society. Their tireless work and joint
        efforts allowed RCS to maintain its viability and overcome all obstacles
        as a whole.
      </p>
      <div className={styles.image}>
        <Image src={img5} alt="hero" sizes="100%" priority />
      </div>
      <p>
        Centurions – those who put great efforts into the development and
        progress of the community, occupied the next step in this hierarchy.
        Elected and skilled leaders, they devoted their time and talent with
        fervent zeal to researching new technologies, developing innovative
        strategies and approaches to improving society's life. Thanks to their
        dedication and entrepreneurial spirit, the community has steadily moved
        forward, remaining at the forefront of progress.
      </p>

      <p>
        The legates, at the next stage, were the embodiment of the inspiration
        and wisdom with which they filled their lives. Their essence is
        completely imbued with the idea of community development and helping the
        world. The legates not only had deep knowledge in various fields, but
        also passed on their experience and wisdom to the community. They led
        projects, organized educational programs, and promoted social harmony
        within RCS and Ethereum.
      </p>
      <p>
        Senators held a special position in the hierarchy. They were the
        guardians of financial well-being and at the same time the main arbiters
        in all matters related to discoveries and financing of projects.
        Senators were at the center of events, making decisions about the
        allocation of resources and determining the future development of the
        community. Their wisdom, wealth and leadership qualities ensured the
        prosperity of Ethereum.
      </p>
      <div className={styles.image}>
        <Image src={img10} alt="hero" sizes="100%" priority />
      </div>
      <p>
        There were also Guardian guards in the depths of the Hive City. They
        were the epitome of justice and the main defense force of the community.
        The Guards were the highest military in the Ethereum, providing
        protection from external threats and maintaining the safety of all its
        members. They possessed outstanding fighting skills and passionate
        patriotism. The Guardians were also reliable companions and loyal
        friends of the Founding Creators of the community. Thanks to their
        vigilance and dedication, RCS remained steadfast and successful in all
        its goals. They were human shields protecting the order and all the
        people of the community, the pride of the RCS.
      </p>
      <div className={styles.image}>
        <Image src={img9} alt="hero" sizes="100%" priority />
      </div>
      <p>
        At the top of the hierarchical ladder stood the Creators, founders and
        spiritual leaders of RCS. They were the cornerstones, the parents who
        gave life and inspiration to this wonderful community. The creators not
        only contributed to the creation of Ethereum, but also continued to
        guide its development and preserve the values that formed the basis of
        its existence. They were wise mentors, and their ideas and guidance were
        always recognized and appreciated by all RCS members.
      </p>
      <div className={styles.image}>
        <Image src={img4} alt="hero" sizes="100%" priority />
      </div>
      <p>
        Thus, each rank in the RCS played its own unique role, contributing to
        the balance, diversity and progress of the community. This perfect
        symbiosis of leaders, workers and inspirers made RCS a model of a strong
        and purposeful society, where everyone had their place and their
        contribution was significant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite obstacles and adversities, Ethereon and RCS have become the
        personification of light in darkness, showing how a person can use
        technological wonders to create a sustainable and enchanting world.
        Their fabulous chronicles unequivocally testify that even in the raging
        stream of catastrophes, the human spirit overcomes all difficulties,
        giving birth to something beautiful and sublime. In this world, humans
        have merged with nanites, creating a new form of existence and gaining
        the power to adapt to unforeseen changes.
