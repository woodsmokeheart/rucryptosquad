        In the dim light, in the bar, old blues was playing from a floppy disk
        that a familiar resident brought from another raid to the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ashley Sparks, twirling her favorite gray curl around her finger, looked
        at her reflection in the polished steel bar and smiled slightly. Her
        face was perfect, as always. Thanks to the nanites in her body, she
        could change her appearance at will. Today, she decided to remain
        herself - the mysterious barmaid at Nano, which was located in the heart
        of the underground city of Ethereon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ashley didn't remember much from her childhood. Her memories were
        scattered like shards of glass, and only a few vivid images remained in
        her memory. Sunset in the mountains, the figure of a man in a raincoat
        and a cowboy hat next to her. This man's name was Kevin, and his eyes
        were so familiar... I've never been able to figure out why, but in my
        surviving memories, he was like my own.
      </p>
      <p>
        She took a small sip of her favorite gin and sighed contentedly. How
        much time has passed since then.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most vivid memory was of a huge explosion that caused terror even in
        her dreams. He and Kevin hid as best they could after the incident, and
        even found a settlement where those who managed to survive the disaster
        gathered. But after a few nights, Kevin left without even saying goodbye
        to Ashley. This moment will forever remain a mystery to her.
      </p>
      <p>
        More flashes of consciousness and loss of parts of memory. The nanites
        that were supposed to help turned out to be useless…
      </p>
      <p>
        Ashley felt the changes. Just recently, the RCS technician checked its
        structure again, but could not say anything about the new nanite that
        had recently been activated. It's a strange thing. She hadn't seen the
        First One in a very long time. And the "new" nanite woke up just three
        years after their last meeting. Well, how are the meetings. Rather, it
        was something like a last hug. He never touched people or showed his
        emotions, and then he almost strangled them. Such a farewell is
        memorable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Six months after that unfortunate explosion, a man came to the
        settlement. The acquaintance turned out to be strange. When they met, he
        stared into her eyes for a long time, then muttered: "I finally found
        her." Ashley still didn't understand what he was interested in. He told
        her about what happened and why people began to change. He also talked
        about strengthening and predicted that the time would come when she
        would be able to use her abilities to their full potential. Ashley
        didn't really believe in his words, although the man was doing
        incomprehensible things. He calmly, at will, changed his appearance,
        lifted pieces of rocks with one hand, and could even influence the
        weather. Ashley was interested in being around him, so she got attached
        to him pretty quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a while, the First One, as they began to call him in the
        settlement, invited everyone to go with him to the city that he was
        building underground. The construction was carried out according to a
        predetermined scheme by nanites, so that a year later, Ethereon, as the
        city was called, was already ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the construction, as the First One said, many people began to
        feel changes in themselves. Nanites changed human organisms at will.
        There were also disadvantages. People changed in appearance, and
        sometimes looked more like cyborgs than humans. Only the First One
        always outwardly remained the most ordinary, unremarkable person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ashley also felt the changes, but they started much earlier than the
        others. And she was better able to control her symbionts than others.
        That's why appearance wasn't a problem for her.
      </p>
      <p>How much water has flowed away…</p>
      <p>
        The glass in her hand cracked, and Ashley felt stifled. She knew it
        would happen sooner or later, but she didn't know when. A wild buzzing
        started in my ears. Ashley looked at her new tattoo, which was now
        shining with a bright purple light-the “new” nanite had begun the
        adaptation process. The first bottle broke on the bar stand, then the
        second... I remembered the sunset in the mountains again. The time has
        come... The transformation has begun. Ethereon is waiting for a change…
