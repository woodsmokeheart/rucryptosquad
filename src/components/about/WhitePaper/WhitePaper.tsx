      <h1>Who are we?</h1>
      <p>
        We are the Ru Crypto Squad (RCS). A decentralized Autonomous
        Organization (DAO) adapted to the Russian Federation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are a community focused on promoting blockchain technologies in the
        Russian segment.
      </p>
      <h2>What did we come for?</h2>
      <p>
        Our goals are to spread literacy among the Russian community in the
        cryptosphere and create a better Russian community.
      </p>
      <h2>How are we going to achieve this?</h2>
      <p>We have mixed approaches.</p>
      <p>
        Help. We absolutely help our participants by answering their questions,
        help with transactions, give advice on which assets are worth looking at
        and explain where the pitfalls may be. We explain how to use a scan or
        markers, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Income. We dont talk, we do. Already those members of our community who
        are currently part of it were able to appreciate the tips on drops,
        crypto-caledari and some insider information. Those who turned out to be
        really attentive to the advice, but did not forget to think with their
        own heads, they all earned well and continue to multiply their savings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Communication. We have our own private chat in which there is a lot of
        information that is not available anywhere else, because it is gained
        from the experience of other people. Transactions that do not require
        human verification are constantly taking place in it, because there is
        absolute trust in the holder of our token. Also, in it, participants on
        an ongoing basis provide links to various activities in the
        cryptosphere. These are new drops of collections and activity on
        exchanges and just current news from the crypto universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Activity. Both in our official group and in the community chat, various
        promotions, sweepstakes and auctions are held on an ongoing basis. Some
        of them are for RCS members only and the prizes there are really
        impressive, and some, in the group, for everyone who wants to try their
        luck.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ethereon. In order for the participants to be even more interested in
        diving into the essence of blockchain technologies and the crypto
        universe, we have come up with a unique authors world, the history of
        which changes with the appearance of new participants and to which our
        main NFT collection with excellent utilities is linked. And only here
        you can sit in our bar and chat with our wonderful NPC bartender Ashley
        Sparks, who will be happy to listen to you, joke with you and support
        you in Laura.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its own ranking system. We have already said above that our DAO is
        adapted to the Russian Federation. So the management is autonomous by
        itself, but we decided to leave a certain ranking system that allows you
        to determine the weight of a participants voice from his activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Transparency of the relationship. Everything is very simple here. The
        earned assets are spent on community development. These are birthday
        gifts, buying currency or NFT for activities, paying for freelance
        support, etc.
      </p>
